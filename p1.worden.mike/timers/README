Instructions:
Download the tar file, and extract the files using tar -xvf timer-api.tar
Compile the code by typing make at the command line
Execute the test application by typing ./test-app at the command line.

Operation:
The test application defines two timers: one that fires every 3
seconds and the other that fires every 10 seconds. The program
demonstrates how event queues can be used to keep track of multiple
timers using a single select call. 
The program can be terminated using Ctrl+C 

We have added a C language binding to the Timer API. To run the test
application using the C language binding type ./test-app-c
